# Paper_CodeGeneration

Abstract:

This paper proposes a method that can generate
complete software components for embedded systems, fitting
seamlessly into existing implementations without developer intervention. We demonstrate this approach by automatically
generating hardware abstraction layer (HAL) code for GPIO
operations on the STM32F407 microcontroller. The proposed
method utilizes Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) to analyze existing
code and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce
the missing components, effectively enabling code completion for
embedded applications.
